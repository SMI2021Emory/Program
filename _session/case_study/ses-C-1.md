      title: Inverse Problems in Magnetic Resonance Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping 
      abstract: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a recently developed magnetic resonance technique that allows (semi-)quantification of the spatial distribution of the magnetic susceptibility properties of tissues. This technique has been shown to be sensitive to iron concentration, white matter myelination in the brain as well as their alterations in pathological conditions. The reconstruction of QSM images involves solving inverse problems of ill-posed systems. In this presentation, I will introduce the problems and current techniques in solving these inverse problems in QSM as well as pitfalls for further development. Some clinical applications of QSM will also be presented.

      title: Advances in Quantitative MRI Signal Modeling in Musculoskeletal Research
      abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging is capable of providing a broad range of contrasts reflecting a variety of intrinsic properties of the underlying tissue system. Musculoskeletal tissues have widely varied cellular composition and extracellular matrix components and these have direct impact on their underlying functional properties. New MRI methods have sought to discover early changes in degeneration and disease, when emerging disease-modifying interventions may be most effective. Considerable effort is devoted to the development of quantitative approaches with improved specificity to tissue status. In this talk, I will outline some recent advances in MRI signal modeling and describe some of the opportunities and challenges moving forward as they pertain to applications in diagnostic imaging and musculoskeletal research.

      title:  In vivo metabolic imaging with magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the brain relies on signal from water protons to generate structural and functional images. A lesser known yet complementary method, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), facilitates quantification of non-water compounds to provide localized chemical and metabolic information. While MRS is a powerful FDA-approved method available on most MR scanners, low signal-to-noise ratios and long acquisition times preclude widespread clinical integration. In this talk, I will review the basic principles of MRS, discuss challenges and opportunities for technical development, and provide case-study examples of MRS applications in brain injury and disease.
