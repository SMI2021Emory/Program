  title: A Novel Correlation based Co-localization Analysis of Super-resolution Images
  abstract: Super resolution imaging techniques have significantly improved the resolution of
  microscopic images from 250 to a few nanometers over the past decades, resulting in data format
  evolving from color intensity arrays to precise coordinated locations. Hence, new coordinate based
  statistical methods using precise locational information to study co localization of dual color
  spatial points in super resolution microscopy images are in high demand. In this study, we propose
  a new correlation based method, named Normalized Spatial Intensity Correlation ( NSInC , “in synch”),
  to quantify the degree of co localization with area based edge effect corrections which removes
  biasedness in the current available methods. Simulations and real applications are provided for
  illustrating the validity and applicability.

  title: Combining Batches of High-Dimensional Multiplexed Images
  abstract: 'High-dimensional multiplexed imaging methods can help quantify the heterogeneity of cell
populations in healthy and tumorous tissues, offering insight into tumor progression and
improved treatment strategies. However, implicit biases exist in the imaging pipeline - images
are distorted by optical effects, slide and batch effects, and instrument variability. Normalization
of this data is compounded by the number of markers and natural tissue variability within each
image, introducing systematic differences that impact inference. In this work, we introduce an
image normalization pipeline to reduce systematic variability in multiplexed images by correcting
for batch effects. We build on existing methods to compare the following approaches to correct
for the batch effects in the data: a logarithmic transformation, a simple standardization (division
by the mean), and approaches that adapt ComBat and functional data registration. We
demonstrate these methods by analyzing multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) images of
human colorectal tissue samples to quantify the reduction in variability of the data, namely using
thresholding methods and random effects models. We further demonstrate the method's ability
to retain biological signal by evaluating prediction accuracy of models for specific regions
containing tumors in the tissue samples.'

  title: PPA: Principal Parcellation Analysis for Brain Connectomes and Multiple Traits
  abstract: Our understanding of the structure of the brain and its
  relationships with human traits is largely determined by how we
  represent the structural connectome. Standard practice divides
  the brain into regions of interest (ROIs) and represents the
  connectome as an adjacency matrix having cells measuring
  connectivity between pairs of ROIs. Statistical analyses are then
  heavily driven by the (largely arbitrary) choice of ROIs. We
  propose a novel tractography-based representation of brain
  connectomes, which clusters fiber endpoints to define a data
  adaptive parcellation targeted to explain variation among
  individuals and predict human traits. This representation leads
  to Principal Parcellation Analysis (PPA), representing individual
  brain connectomes by compositional vectors building on a basis
  system of fiber bundles that captures the connectivity at the
  population level. PPA reduces subjectivity and facilitates
  statistical analyses. We illustrate the proposed approach
  through applications to data from the Human Connectome
  Project (HCP) and show that PPA connectomes improve power
  in predicting human traits over state-of-the-art methods based
  on classical connectomes while dramatically improving
  parsimony and maintaining interpretability.

  title: There is increasing evidence on the importance of brain morphology in 
  predicting and classifying mental disorders and behavior. However, most current 
  shape approaches rely heavily on vertex-wise analysis that may not successfully 
  capture complexities of subcortical structures. Additionally, the past works do not 
  include interactions between these structures and exposure factors when modeling 
  clinical or behavioral outcomes. Predictive modeling with such interactions is of
  paramount interest in heterogeneous mental disorders such as PTSD, where trauma 
  exposure and other factors interact with brain shape changes to influence behavior.
  We propose a comprehensive framework that overcomes these limitations by representing 
  brain substructures as continuous parameterized surfaces and quantifying their shape 
  differences using elastic shape metrics. Using the elastic shape metric, we compute 
  shape summaries (mean, covariance, PCs) of subcortical data and represent individual 
  shapes by their principal scores under a PCA basis. These representations allow 
  visualization tools that help understand localized changes when these PCs are varied. 
  Subsequently, these PCs, the auxiliary exposure variables, and their interactions are 
  used for regression modeling and prediction. We apply our method to data from the 
  Grady Trauma Project (GTP), where the goal is to predict clinical measures of PTSD 
  using shapes of brain substructures such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and putamen. Our 
  analysis revealed considerably greater predictive power under the elastic shape analysis 
  than widely used approaches such as the standard vertex-wise shape analysis and even a 
  volumetric analysis. It helped identify local deformations in brain shapes related to 
  change in PTSD severity. To our knowledge, this is one of the first brain shape analysis
  approaches that can seamlessly integrate the pre-processing steps under one umbrella for 
  improved accuracy and are naturally able to account for interactions between brain shape 
  and additional covariates to yield superior predictive performance when modeling clinical 
  outcomes. Interactive visualizations are available in the 
  GitHub repository (https://github.com/wuyx5/Elastic-Shape-Analysis-PTSD).

  title: Multi-scale Graph Principal Component Analysis for Connectomics
  abstract: In brain connectomics, it is common to divide the cortical surface 
  into discrete regions of interest (ROIs) and then to use these regions to induce a graph. 
  The structure of the resulting adjacency matrices depends critically on the chosen regions, 
  leading to dramatically different inference when different regions are chosen. To solve 
  this problem we develop a multi-scale graph model, which links together scale-specific 
  factorizations through common individual-specific latent factors. These scores combine information across 
  from different parcellations to produce a single interpretable summary of an individuals brain structure. We
  develop a simple, efficient algorithm, and illustrate substantial advantages over comparable 
  single-scale methods in both simulations and analyses of the Human Connectome Project dataset.

  title: Quantifying brain age prediction uncertainty from imaging using scalar-on-image quantile regression
  abstract: Prediction of subject age from brain anatomical MRI has the potential to provide a 
  sensitive summary of brain changes, indicative of different neurodegenerative diseases. 
  However, existing studies typically neglect the uncertainty of these predictions. In this work we 
  take into account this uncertainty by applying methods of functional data analysis. We propose
  a penalized functional quantile regression model of age on brain structure with cognitively
  normal (CN) subjects in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and
  use it to predict brain age in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease
  (AD) subjects. Unlike the machine learning approaches available in the literature of brain
  age prediction, which provide only point predictions, the outcome of our model is a prediction
  interval for each subject. The prediction accuracy obtained with this model is similar
  to more sophisticated approaches, while being also more principled and interpretable. The
  gap between predicted and chronological age correlates with cognitive decline.

  title: Outlier Detection for Multi-Network Data
  abstract: It has become routine in neuroscience studies to measure brain networks for 
  different individuals using neuroimaging. These networks are expressed as adjacency matrices, 
  with each cell containing a summary of connectivity between a pair of brain regions. There is 
  an emerging statistical literature describing methods for the analysis of such multi-network data
  in which nodes are common across networks, but the edges vary. However, such brain connectome 
  data often consist of outliers from various sources. First, the data can be corrupted by noise 
  from various sources during the data collection phase like physical movement of the subject during
  the scanning process. In addition, structural connectivity reconstruction is a complex process, 
  consisting of many steps and relying on many different open-source software suites. A small mistake
  in the pipeline (e.g., brain tissue segmentation error) will be propagated and amplified to the 
  final connectivity output. . For such individuals, the resulting adjacency matrix may be mostly 
  zeros or may exhibit a bizarre pattern not consistent with a normal brain network. Previous quality 
  controls of these pipelines heavily rely on man power through visualization of intermediate results,
  which is time consuming and impractical for large datasets such as UK Biobank. However, if not accounted 
  for carefully, the outlying connectomes can be influential in subsequent statistical analyses. We 
  propose a simple method for network outlier detection (NOD) relying on an approximation of the influence 
  function under a hierarchical generalized linear model for the adjacency matrices. Our NOD method is 
  illustrated through an application to data from the UK Biobank.

  title: Structural Brain Asymmetries in Youths with Combined and Inattentive Presentations of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
  abstract: 'Alterations in structural brain asymmetry are reported in attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
  Here we replicate left-right asymmetry in combined and inattentive ADHD. Methods: We investigate asymmetry index 
  (AI) across 13 subcortical and 33 cortical regions from anatomical metrics of volume, surface area, and thickness. 
  Structural T1- weighted MRI data were obtained from youths with ADHD-C (n1 = 51) and ADHD-I (n2 = 64), and aged-matched 
  controls (n0 = 298). We used a linear mixed effects model that accounts for data site heterogeneity, while studying 
  associations between AI and covariates of presentation and age. Results: After study-wide correction for multiple comparisons, 
  ADHD-Inattentive had greater rightward asymmetry in thickness of the inferior temporal (t = −3.72, p-value < 10−5), along with 
  age (t = 3.54, p-value < 10−5). Regions that did not satisfy the multiple testing correction support functional MRI results of 
  disrupted connectivity in motor networks from ADHD-C and default mode from ADHD-I. Conclusions: Temporal deficits may differentiate 
  ADHD presentations. Symptom severity can determine if brain asymmetry patterns are causal or compensatory. Significance: Structural 
  brain asymmetry may provide neurobiological insight into ADHD presentations. Using linear mixed effects model, one can conduct formal 
  statistical inference on associations between brain asymmetries, diagnosis, and neurodevelopment.'

  title: Statistical Shape Analysis of Elastic Graphs
  abstract: This research project develops a comprehensive framework for generative statistical 
  analysis of elastic shape graphs. Examples of such graphs include road networks, brain arterial 
  networks, brain fiber tracts, retinal blood vessels, etc. We represent an elastic shape graph as a 
  collection of nodes that are connected by (2D or 3D) curves or edges with arbitrary shapes. Using
  a novel mathematical representation and a Riemannian metric on this representation, we seek geometrical 
  tools such as computations of geodesics, means and covariances, and PCA, for modeling and testing 
  such graphical shapes. This work further introduces an efficient method to calculate means of shape 
  graphs and also explores the use of landmarks in improving registration of nodes. These ideas are 
  illustrated using simulated as well as real data examples.

  title: BICNet: A Bayesian Approach for Estimating Task Effects on Intrinsic Connectivity Networks in fMRI Data
  abstract: 'Intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) are specific dynamic functional brain networks that are 
  consistently found under various conditions including rest and task. Studies have shown that some stimuli 
  actually activate intrinsic connectivity through either suppression, excitation, moderation or modification. 
  Nevertheless, the structure of ICNs and task-related effects on ICNs are not yet fully understood. 
  In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Intrinsic Connectivity Network (BICNet) model to identify the ICNs 
  and quantify the task-related effects on the ICN dynamics. Using an extended Bayesian dynamic sparse 
  latent factor model, the proposed BICNet has the following advantages: (1) it simultaneously identifies the 
  individual ICNs and group-level ICN spatial maps; (2) it robustly identifies ICNs by jointly 
  modeling resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) and task-related 
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (tfMRI); (3) compared to independent component 
  analysis (ICA)-based methods, it can quantify the difference of ICNs amplitudes across 
  different states; (4) it automatically performs feature selection through the sparsity of the 
  ICNs rather than ad-hoc thresholding. The proposed BICNet was applied to the rfMRI and 
  language tfMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the analysis identified several ICNs 
  related to distinct language processing functions.'

  title: BICNet: A Bayesian Approach for Estimating Task Effects on Intrinsic Connectivity Networks in fMRI Data
  abstract: 'Anemia detection requires invasive blood testing with the gold standard hemoglobin level by a 
  complete blood count (CBC). This procedure involves phlebotomy, which could lead to certain adverse effects. 
  We consider a recently proposed non-invasive method for monitoring anemia with a fingernail image taken from
  patients. Non-invasive anemia detection involves procedure of extracting color data from patients’ fingernail
  bed smartphone images. The color data are extracted in RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color space. Since it is unknown
  that which color space transformation is most useful in discriminating anemia population vs healthy population,
  our work focused on determining which transformation of RGB (Red, Green, Blue) data would produce the best 
  separation among anemic and control subjects. Several metrics are used to access the separation between anemia 
  and healthy groups based on within sum of squares and between sum of squares (Metric 1: Ratio of within variation
  to between variation). It is shown that HSI (Hue, Saturation, Intensity) color space performs the best in comparison
  to all other color spaces (Metric 1: 1.02, (95% CI: 0.82-1.35) for HSI, Metric 1: 0.76 (95% CI: 0.56-1.05) for RGB).
  The HSI color space also produced the lowest mean squared errors in predicting anemia status using Lasso Regression 
  method (MSE for HSI: 0.085, For RGB: 0.096). We conclude HSI color space as the best color space in separating 
  anemia vs control.'

  title: Analysis of multichannel brain signals via nonparametric Bayesian mixtures of autoregressive kernels
  abstract: To analyze multichannel brain signals, we develop a novel approach to identify the most prevalent
  oscillatory activity within each channel and decompose the multivariate signals in their common
  oscillatory patterns present among channels to characterize different types of associations between
  pairs of channels. 
  The current approach is to analyze power at subjectively predefined frequency bands; this is a
  serious limitation because it does not allow the data to identify specific peaks power and location
  that are associated with the cognitive demands. 
  To overcome the limitations of current approaches, we develop the Multivariate Bayesian Mixture 
  Auto-Regressive Decomposition (MBMARD) that identifies from the data (rather than apriori 
  assumed) (i) the number of common prominent peaks across channels, (ii) the frequency peak 
  locations, and (iii) their corresponding spread of power around the peaks. 
  The MBMARD method jointly model the spectral functions of multichannel signals as a multimodal 
  PDF via a Dirichlet Process (DP) mixture based on a kernel derived from second-order 
  auto-regressive processes (AR(2)) with unique spectral density having a single peak. 
  Under the MBMARD approach, the multichannel signals are modeled as a mixture of AR(2) latent 
  processes capturing the associations strength between channels through the mixture weights from 
  the DP model. 
  The simulation studies demonstrate the robustness and performance of the MBMARD method. 
  We present the analysis of local field potential (LFP) activity on multiple tetrodes from the hippocampus 
  of laboratory rats during a non spatial memory task giving new insightful results on 
  frequency specific power changes over different experimental conditions. 
  We also present a second analysis on multichannel human EEG data from an alcoholic and control 
  subjects were MBMARD accounts for between-subject variation in capturing frequency-specific 
  power associations among different brain regions.

  title: A Regression Framework for Brain Network Distance Metrics
  abstract: 'Analyzing brain networks has long been a prominent research topic in neuroimaging. 
  However, statistical methods to detect differences between these networks and relate them to 
  phenotypic traits are still sorely needed. Our previous work developed a novel permutation 
  testing framework to detect differences between two groups. Here we advance that work to allow 
  both assessing differences by continuous phenotypes and controlling for confounding variables. 
  To achieve this, we propose an innovative regression framework to relate distances between brain 
  network features to functions of absolute differences in continuous covariates and indicators of
  difference for categorical variables. We explore several similarity metrics for comparing distances
  between connection matrices, and adapt several standard methods for estimation and inference within
  our framework: Standard F-test, F-test with individual level effects (ILE), Generalized Least Squares 
  (GLS), Mixed Model, and Permutation. We also propose a novel modification of the standard GLS approach
  for estimation and inference. We assess all approaches for estimation and inference via simulation 
  studies, and illustrate the utility of our framework by analyzing the relationship between fluid intelligence 
  and brain network distances in Human Connectome Project (HCP) data.'

  title: Shape-on-Shape Regression based on Unitary Operators
  abstract: 'We focus on a specific subproblem in functional regression models where both 
  predictors and responses are "shapes" of functional variables. We can find examples of this problem 
  in neuroimaging, epidemiology, finance, and biology. Taking the elastic shape analysis approach, 
  we represent shapes of functions using the square-root velocity functions (SRVFs), elements of a 
  unit Hilbert sphere or a preshape space. Removing the unwanted transformations (time warping, etc.) 
  leads to a quotient space or a shape space. We model the conditional mean of the response shapes as 
  "rigid rotations" of the predictors on the Hilbert sphere and the noise using the Fisher von Mises 
  distribution. We derive the theory and algorithms for the pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimator of this 
  unitary operator given observed paired data. This solution is developed in two steps: we first develop
  the estimation framework for the preshape space and then extend it to the shape space. We demonstrate 
  these ideas on two synthetic datasets as well as a real dataset, the pairs of Covid-19 case curves and 
  death curves in 51 US states.'

  title: Image-on-scalar Regression with Latent Subgroup Identification using Expectation Maximization
  abstract: 'Image-on-scalar regression has been a popular approach to modeling the association between 
  brain activities (image response) and clinical characteristics (scalar predictors) in neuroimaging
  research. The recent large neuroimaging studies, e.g., the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development 
  (ABCD) study, indicate that this type of association may be heterogenous across individuals in the population. 
  It is of great interest to identify subgroups of individuals from the population such that: 1) within 
  each subgroup the brain activity is homogenously associated with the clinical characteristics; 2) across 
  subgroups the associations are different; and 3) the group allocation depends on individual characteristics.
  The existing image-on-scalar regression methods, such as the spatially varying coefficient model (SVCM) and
  other clustering methods, e.g., k-means, cannot directly achieve this goal. To address this challenge, we 
  propose a novel latent subgroup image-on-scalar regression model (LASIR) for analysis of large-scale and 
  heterogenous neuroimaging data collected from multiple sites. In LASIR, we introduce the latent subgroup
  indicator for each individual, the group-specific spatially varying coefficients and random effects for 
  experimental sites. We adopt an efficient stochastic expectation maximization algorithm for model inferences.
  We demonstrate that LASIR outperforms the existing alternatives for subgroup identification of brain activation 
  patterns via extensive simulations and analyses of working-memory task fMRI data in the ABCD study.'

  title: Investigating latent neurocircuitry traits underlying brain dynamic functional connectome
  abstract: In recent years, the analysis of brain network connectivity has become increasingly popular in neuroscience research. 
  Investigating brain functional connectome as well as its change across time provides insights into the dynamic 
  nature of brain organizations. However, such analyses often face some major challenges including the high 
  dimensionality of brain networks, unknown latent sources underlying the observed connectivity, and the large number 
  of brain connections leading to spurious _ndings. In our research, we aim to characterize 
  various neural circuits underlying dynamic brain functional connectivity using a novel blind source separation (BSS) 
  framework with low-rank structure and an angle-based sparsity regularization. Our proposed method captures the 
  dynamic profiles of different neural circuits, reveals key brain regions or nodes that drive each of these circuits and 
  identifies neural circuits associated with disease phenotypes. In this talk, we will introduce the methodology of 
  our dynamic connectome source separation method and also present our findings on dynamic neurocircuitry traits extracted
  from a resting-state fMRI study.
