  title: A Novel Correlation based Co-localization Analysis of Super-resolution Images
  abstract: 'Super resolution imaging techniques have significantly improved the resolution of
  microscopic images from 250 to a few nanometers over the past decades, resulting in data format
  evolving from color intensity arrays to precise coordinated locations. Hence, new coordinate based
  statistical methods using precise locational information to study co localization of dual color
  spatial points in super resolution microscopy images are in high demand. In this study, we propose
  a new correlation based method, named Normalized Spatial Intensity Correlation ( NSInC , “in synch”),
  to quantify the degree of co localization with area based edge effect corrections which removes
  biasedness in the current available methods. Simulations and real applications are provided for
  illustrating the validity and applicability.'

  title: Combining Batches of High-Dimensional Multiplexed Images
  abstract: 'High-dimensional multiplexed imaging methods can help quantify the heterogeneity of cell
populations in healthy and tumorous tissues, offering insight into tumor progression and
improved treatment strategies. However, implicit biases exist in the imaging pipeline - images
are distorted by optical effects, slide and batch effects, and instrument variability. Normalization
of this data is compounded by the number of markers and natural tissue variability within each
image, introducing systematic differences that impact inference. In this work, we introduce an
image normalization pipeline to reduce systematic variability in multiplexed images by correcting
for batch effects. We build on existing methods to compare the following approaches to correct
for the batch effects in the data: a logarithmic transformation, a simple standardization (division
by the mean), and approaches that adapt ComBat and functional data registration. We
demonstrate these methods by analyzing multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) images of
human colorectal tissue samples to quantify the reduction in variability of the data, namely using
thresholding methods and random effects models. We further demonstrate the method''s ability
to retain biological signal by evaluating prediction accuracy of models for specific regions
containing tumors in the tissue samples.'

  title: 'PPA: Principal Parcellation Analysis for Brain Connectomes and Multiple Traits'
  abstract: 'Our understanding of the structure of the brain and its
  relationships with human traits is largely determined by how we
  represent the structural connectome. Standard practice divides
  the brain into regions of interest (ROIs) and represents the
  connectome as an adjacency matrix having cells measuring
  connectivity between pairs of ROIs. Statistical analyses are then
  heavily driven by the (largely arbitrary) choice of ROIs. We
  propose a novel tractography-based representation of brain
  connectomes, which clusters fiber endpoints to define a data
  adaptive parcellation targeted to explain variation among
  individuals and predict human traits. This representation leads
  to Principal Parcellation Analysis (PPA), representing individual
  brain connectomes by compositional vectors building on a basis
  system of fiber bundles that captures the connectivity at the
  population level. PPA reduces subjectivity and facilitates
  statistical analyses. We illustrate the proposed approach
  through applications to data from the Human Connectome
  Project (HCP) and show that PPA connectomes improve power
  in predicting human traits over state-of-the-art methods based
  on classical connectomes while dramatically improving
  parsimony and maintaining interpretability.'

  title: 'There is increasing evidence on the importance of brain morphology in 
  predicting and classifying mental disorders and behavior. However, most current 
  shape approaches rely heavily on vertex-wise analysis that may not successfully 
  capture complexities of subcortical structures. Additionally, the past works do not 
  include interactions between these structures and exposure factors when modeling 
  clinical or behavioral outcomes. Predictive modeling with such interactions is of
  paramount interest in heterogeneous mental disorders such as PTSD, where trauma 
  exposure and other factors interact with brain shape changes to influence behavior.
  We propose a comprehensive framework that overcomes these limitations by representing 
  brain substructures as continuous parameterized surfaces and quantifying their shape 
  differences using elastic shape metrics. Using the elastic shape metric, we compute 
  shape summaries (mean, covariance, PCs) of subcortical data and represent individual 
  shapes by their principal scores under a PCA basis. These representations allow 
  visualization tools that help understand localized changes when these PCs are varied. 
  Subsequently, these PCs, the auxiliary exposure variables, and their interactions are 
  used for regression modeling and prediction. We apply our method to data from the 
  Grady Trauma Project (GTP), where the goal is to predict clinical measures of PTSD 
  using shapes of brain substructures such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and putamen. Our 
  analysis revealed considerably greater predictive power under the elastic shape analysis 
  than widely used approaches such as the standard vertex-wise shape analysis and even a 
  volumetric analysis. It helped identify local deformations in brain shapes related to 
  change in PTSD severity. To our knowledge, this is one of the first brain shape analysis
  approaches that can seamlessly integrate the pre-processing steps under one umbrella for 
  improved accuracy and are naturally able to account for interactions between brain shape 
  and additional covariates to yield superior predictive performance when modeling clinical 
  outcomes. Interactive visualizations are available in the 
  GitHub repository (https://github.com/wuyx5/Elastic-Shape-Analysis-PTSD).'

  title: Multi-scale Graph Principal Component Analysis for Connectomics
  abstract: 'In brain connectomics, it is common to divide the cortical surface 
  into discrete regions of interest (ROIs) and then to use these regions to induce a graph. 
  The structure of the resulting adjacency matrices depends critically on the chosen regions, 
  leading to dramatically different inference when different regions are chosen. To solve 
  this problem we develop a multi-scale graph model, which links together scale-specific 
  factorizations through common individual-specific latent factors. These scores combine information across 
  from different parcellations to produce a single interpretable summary of an individuals brain structure. We
  develop a simple, efficient algorithm, and illustrate substantial advantages over comparable 
  single-scale methods in both simulations and analyses of the Human Connectome Project dataset.'

  title: Quantifying brain age prediction uncertainty from imaging using scalar-on-image quantile regression
  abstract: 'Prediction of subject age from brain anatomical MRI has the potential to provide a 
  sensitive summary of brain changes, indicative of different neurodegenerative diseases. 
  However, existing studies typically neglect the uncertainty of these predictions. In this work we 
  take into account this uncertainty by applying methods of functional data analysis. We propose
  a penalized functional quantile regression model of age on brain structure with cognitively
  normal (CN) subjects in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and
  use it to predict brain age in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease
  (AD) subjects. Unlike the machine learning approaches available in the literature of brain
  age prediction, which provide only point predictions, the outcome of our model is a prediction
  interval for each subject. The prediction accuracy obtained with this model is similar
  to more sophisticated approaches, while being also more principled and interpretable. The
  gap between predicted and chronological age correlates with cognitive decline.'

  title: Outlier Detection for Multi-Network Data
  abstract: 'It has become routine in neuroscience studies to measure brain networks for 
  different individuals using neuroimaging. These networks are expressed as adjacency matrices, 
  with each cell containing a summary of connectivity between a pair of brain regions. There is 
  an emerging statistical literature describing methods for the analysis of such multi-network data
  in which nodes are common across networks, but the edges vary. However, such brain connectome 
  data often consist of outliers from various sources. First, the data can be corrupted by noise 
  from various sources during the data collection phase like physical movement of the subject during
  the scanning process. In addition, structural connectivity reconstruction is a complex process, 
  consisting of many steps and relying on many different open-source software suites. A small mistake
  in the pipeline (e.g., brain tissue segmentation error) will be propagated and amplified to the 
  final connectivity output. . For such individuals, the resulting adjacency matrix may be mostly 
  zeros or may exhibit a bizarre pattern not consistent with a normal brain network. Previous quality 
  controls of these pipelines heavily rely on man power through visualization of intermediate results,
  which is time consuming and impractical for large datasets such as UK Biobank. However, if not accounted 
  for carefully, the outlying connectomes can be influential in subsequent statistical analyses. We 
  propose a simple method for network outlier detection (NOD) relying on an approximation of the influence 
  function under a hierarchical generalized linear model for the adjacency matrices. Our NOD method is 
  illustrated through an application to data from the UK Biobank.'

  title: Structural Brain Asymmetries in Youths with Combined and Inattentive Presentations of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
  abstract: 'Alterations in structural brain asymmetry are reported in attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
  Here we replicate left-right asymmetry in combined and inattentive ADHD. Methods: We investigate asymmetry index 
  (AI) across 13 subcortical and 33 cortical regions from anatomical metrics of volume, surface area, and thickness. 
  Structural T1- weighted MRI data were obtained from youths with ADHD-C (n1 = 51) and ADHD-I (n2 = 64), and aged-matched 
  controls (n0 = 298). We used a linear mixed effects model that accounts for data site heterogeneity, while studying 
  associations between AI and covariates of presentation and age. Results: After study-wide correction for multiple comparisons, 
  ADHD-Inattentive had greater rightward asymmetry in thickness of the inferior temporal (t = −3.72, p-value < 10−5), along with 
  age (t = 3.54, p-value < 10−5). Regions that did not satisfy the multiple testing correction support functional MRI results of 
  disrupted connectivity in motor networks from ADHD-C and default mode from ADHD-I. Conclusions: Temporal deficits may differentiate 
  ADHD presentations. Symptom severity can determine if brain asymmetry patterns are causal or compensatory. Significance: Structural 
  brain asymmetry may provide neurobiological insight into ADHD presentations. Using linear mixed effects model, one can conduct formal 
  statistical inference on associations between brain asymmetries, diagnosis, and neurodevelopment.'

  title: 'BICNet: A Bayesian Approach for Estimating Task Effects on Intrinsic Connectivity Networks in fMRI Data'
  abstract: 'Intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) are specific dynamic functional brain networks that are 
  consistently found under various conditions including rest and task. Studies have shown that some stimuli 
  actually activate intrinsic connectivity through either suppression, excitation, moderation or modification. 
  Nevertheless, the structure of ICNs and task-related effects on ICNs are not yet fully understood. 
  In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Intrinsic Connectivity Network (BICNet) model to identify the ICNs 
  and quantify the task-related effects on the ICN dynamics. Using an extended Bayesian dynamic sparse 
  latent factor model, the proposed BICNet has the following advantages: (1) it simultaneously identifies the 
  individual ICNs and group-level ICN spatial maps; (2) it robustly identifies ICNs by jointly 
  modeling resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) and task-related 
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (tfMRI); (3) compared to independent component 
  analysis (ICA)-based methods, it can quantify the difference of ICNs amplitudes across 
  different states; (4) it automatically performs feature selection through the sparsity of the 
  ICNs rather than ad-hoc thresholding. The proposed BICNet was applied to the rfMRI and 
  language tfMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the analysis identified several ICNs 
  related to distinct language processing functions.'

  title: Evaluation of color space transformations in separating anemia vs control subjects
  abstract: 'Anemia detection requires invasive blood testing with the gold standard hemoglobin level by a 
  complete blood count (CBC). This procedure involves phlebotomy, which could lead to certain adverse effects. 
  We consider a recently proposed non-invasive method for monitoring anemia with a fingernail image taken from
  patients. Non-invasive anemia detection involves procedure of extracting color data from patients’ fingernail
  bed smartphone images. The color data are extracted in RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color space. Since it is unknown
  that which color space transformation is most useful in discriminating anemia population vs healthy population,
  our work focused on determining which transformation of RGB (Red, Green, Blue) data would produce the best 
  separation among anemic and control subjects. Several metrics are used to access the separation between anemia 
  and healthy groups based on within sum of squares and between sum of squares (Metric 1: Ratio of within variation
  to between variation). It is shown that HSI (Hue, Saturation, Intensity) color space performs the best in comparison
  to all other color spaces (Metric 1: 1.02, (95% CI: 0.82-1.35) for HSI, Metric 1: 0.76 (95% CI: 0.56-1.05) for RGB).
  The HSI color space also produced the lowest mean squared errors in predicting anemia status using Lasso Regression 
  method (MSE for HSI: 0.085, For RGB: 0.096). We conclude HSI color space as the best color space in separating 
  anemia vs control.'

  title: Analysis of multichannel brain signals via nonparametric Bayesian mixtures of autoregressive kernels
  abstract: 'To analyze multichannel brain signals, we develop a novel approach to identify the most prevalent
  oscillatory activity within each channel and decompose the multivariate signals in their common
  oscillatory patterns present among channels to characterize different types of associations between
  pairs of channels. 
  The current approach is to analyze power at subjectively predefined frequency bands; this is a
  serious limitation because it does not allow the data to identify specific peaks power and location
  that are associated with the cognitive demands. 
  To overcome the limitations of current approaches, we develop the Multivariate Bayesian Mixture 
  Auto-Regressive Decomposition (MBMARD) that identifies from the data (rather than apriori 
  assumed) (i) the number of common prominent peaks across channels, (ii) the frequency peak 
  locations, and (iii) their corresponding spread of power around the peaks. 
  The MBMARD method jointly model the spectral functions of multichannel signals as a multimodal 
  PDF via a Dirichlet Process (DP) mixture based on a kernel derived from second-order 
  auto-regressive processes (AR(2)) with unique spectral density having a single peak. 
  Under the MBMARD approach, the multichannel signals are modeled as a mixture of AR(2) latent 
  processes capturing the associations strength between channels through the mixture weights from 
  the DP model. 
  The simulation studies demonstrate the robustness and performance of the MBMARD method. 
  We present the analysis of local field potential (LFP) activity on multiple tetrodes from the hippocampus 
  of laboratory rats during a non spatial memory task giving new insightful results on 
  frequency specific power changes over different experimental conditions. 
  We also present a second analysis on multichannel human EEG data from an alcoholic and control 
  subjects were MBMARD accounts for between-subject variation in capturing frequency-specific 
  power associations among different brain regions.'

  title: A Regression Framework for Brain Network Distance Metrics
  abstract: 'Analyzing brain networks has long been a prominent research topic in neuroimaging. 
  However, statistical methods to detect differences between these networks and relate them to 
  phenotypic traits are still sorely needed. Our previous work developed a novel permutation 
  testing framework to detect differences between two groups. Here we advance that work to allow 
  both assessing differences by continuous phenotypes and controlling for confounding variables. 
  To achieve this, we propose an innovative regression framework to relate distances between brain 
  network features to functions of absolute differences in continuous covariates and indicators of
  difference for categorical variables. We explore several similarity metrics for comparing distances
  between connection matrices, and adapt several standard methods for estimation and inference within
  our framework: Standard F-test, F-test with individual level effects (ILE), Generalized Least Squares 
  (GLS), Mixed Model, and Permutation. We also propose a novel modification of the standard GLS approach
  for estimation and inference. We assess all approaches for estimation and inference via simulation 
  studies, and illustrate the utility of our framework by analyzing the relationship between fluid intelligence 
  and brain network distances in Human Connectome Project (HCP) data.'

  title: Shape-on-Shape Regression based on Unitary Operators
  abstract: 'We focus on a specific subproblem in functional regression models where both 
  predictors and responses are "shapes" of functional variables. We can find examples of this problem 
  in neuroimaging, epidemiology, finance, and biology. Taking the elastic shape analysis approach, 
  we represent shapes of functions using the square-root velocity functions (SRVFs), elements of a 
  unit Hilbert sphere or a preshape space. Removing the unwanted transformations (time warping, etc.) 
  leads to a quotient space or a shape space. We model the conditional mean of the response shapes as 
  "rigid rotations" of the predictors on the Hilbert sphere and the noise using the Fisher von Mises 
  distribution. We derive the theory and algorithms for the pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimator of this 
  unitary operator given observed paired data. This solution is developed in two steps: we first develop
  the estimation framework for the preshape space and then extend it to the shape space. We demonstrate 
  these ideas on two synthetic datasets as well as a real dataset, the pairs of Covid-19 case curves and 
  death curves in 51 US states.'

  title: Image-on-scalar Regression with Latent Subgroup Identification using Expectation Maximization
  abstract: 'Image-on-scalar regression has been a popular approach to modeling the association between 
  brain activities (image response) and clinical characteristics (scalar predictors) in neuroimaging
  research. The recent large neuroimaging studies, e.g., the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development 
  (ABCD) study, indicate that this type of association may be heterogenous across individuals in the population. 
  It is of great interest to identify subgroups of individuals from the population such that: 1) within 
  each subgroup the brain activity is homogenously associated with the clinical characteristics; 2) across 
  subgroups the associations are different; and 3) the group allocation depends on individual characteristics.
  The existing image-on-scalar regression methods, such as the spatially varying coefficient model (SVCM) and
  other clustering methods, e.g., k-means, cannot directly achieve this goal. To address this challenge, we 
  propose a novel latent subgroup image-on-scalar regression model (LASIR) for analysis of large-scale and 
  heterogenous neuroimaging data collected from multiple sites. In LASIR, we introduce the latent subgroup
  indicator for each individual, the group-specific spatially varying coefficients and random effects for 
  experimental sites. We adopt an efficient stochastic expectation maximization algorithm for model inferences.
  We demonstrate that LASIR outperforms the existing alternatives for subgroup identification of brain activation 
  patterns via extensive simulations and analyses of working-memory task fMRI data in the ABCD study.'

  title: Integrative Learning for Population of Dynamic Networks with Covariates
  abstract: 'Although there is a rapidly growing literature on dynamic connectivity methods, 
  the primary focus has been on separate network estimation for each individual, which fails 
  to leverage common patterns of information. We propose novel graph-theoretic approaches for 
  estimating a population of dynamic networks that are able to borrow information across 
  multiple heterogeneous samples in an unsupervised manner and guided by covariate information. 
  Specifically, we develop a Bayesian product mixture model that imposes independent mixture priors 
  at each time scan and uses covariates to model the mixture weights, which results in time-varying 
  clusters of samples designed to pool information. The computation is carried out using an 
  efficient Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Extensive simulation studies illustrate sharp 
  gains in recovering the true dynamic network over existing dynamic connectivity methods. An
  analysis of fMRI block task data with behavioral interventions reveal sub-groups of individuals 
  having similar dynamic connectivity, and identifies intervention-related dynamic network changes 
  that are concentrated in biologically interpretable brain regions. In contrast, existing dynamic 
  connectivity approaches are able to detect minimal or no changes in connectivity over time, which
  seems biologically unrealistic and highlights the challenges resulting from the inability to 
  systematically borrow information across samples.'

  abstract: 'The most widely used methods for Coordinate Based Meta-Analysis (CBMA) are all
  based on a mass-univariate approach that does not explicitly model the spatial smoothness of
  the distribution of activation foci. Some methods, like ALE, lack an interpretable 
  parameter map which makes regression modelling or group comparisons challenging.  We propose a 
  spatial model that treats the foci as instances of an inhomogeneous Poisson process. We use a 
  log-linear regression with either a Poisson model or a Negative Binomial model that can account
  for excess variance. This provides a generative regression model that estimates a smooth
  intensity function, and can have group-specific intensity functions and study-level regressors.
  While similar spatial Bayesian methods have been proposed, this frequentist model uses a 
  3D tensor product B-spline basis to efficiently model the entire image jointly. We demonstrate the 
  method on a meta-analysis of working memory (WM), comparing studies using verbal stimuli vs

  title: Topological data analysis of dependence structure in brain networks
  abstract: 'Detecting meaningful pattern structures in neural activity is a key 
  task in neuroscience. Recent developments in the field of topological data 
  analysis (TDA) produced tools for practitioners to study and explore the shape 
  of brain data such as electroencephalogram/local field potentials; such methods
  are useful to derive powerful classification algorithms. Classical approaches for
  time series analysis provide tools to analyze “classical features” (such as 
  cross-correlation, cross-cohrerence, partial coherence etc.) of the time series; 
  those features are sensitive to many data transformations and thus are not always
  robust. In contrast, TDA offers a new set of features that provide a summary of
  the data that has a topological meaning, which is not always easily interpretable. 
  However, such approaches that consist in the use of TDA to unravel the shape of data 
  directly can be limited, especially when dealing with stationary snippets of brain
  signals. There are not many papers in TDA literature that explore brain dependence 
  structure. In this poster, we propose a method that explores topological features of 
  coherence matrices. The proposed TopDep method provides a meaningful topological 
  summary of the observed brain signals. We call those topological summaries persistence
  surfaces (PSs). At every frequency, the PS displays a persistence landscape that 
  summaries the topological shape of dependence using the homology groups of different
  dimensions. The center of the empirical distribution of the sample PSs is the analogue
  of the population’s PS, because of the random nature of such summary. To illustrate the 
  ideas above we provide interesting simulations that display a topological behavior in 
  the dependence structure of a population of persistence surfaces and how it can detect 
  outliers. As a next step we will analyze EEG data to show topological behavior in the
  dependece structure of brain signals. The proposed summary is frequency specific (i.e., 
  the topological features are allowed to change across frequency bands) and has the ability 
  to capture the interesting patterns that are present in the data. We derive testing
  procedures based on the bootstrap and permutation approaches that are frequency band 
  specific. This work demonstrates that the persistence surfaces are a powerful new tool 
  for dependence matrix analysis in brain signals, where the brain connectivity network 
  might display interesting topological behavior.'

  title: 'Joint and individual statistical analysis of brain MRI and cognition measures in Alzheimer''s Disease'
  abstract: 'Alzheimer’s Disease is associated with changes that can be measured using multiple modalities such as cognitive assessment and brain volumetry using MRI. Data integration methods, such as the classic Hotelling's canonical correlation analysis (CCA) can find shared or joint structure across multiple datasets/modalities (i.e. data blocks, data matrices). More recent approaches include multiset Canonical Correlation Analysis or M-CCA, Joint and Individual Variance Explained (JIVE), Angle-based JIVE (AJIVE), and others. The JIVE framework decomposes each of two or more data blocks into a joint subspace shared across all blocks, an individual subspace that is unique to each data block, and noise. Here, individual refers to signal unique to a dataset. However, interpreting these subspaces remains challenging. To aid interpretation, we propose an alternative view of the JIVE decomposition and provide an updated estimation method called Canonical JIVE or CJIVE. We apply CJIVE to measurements of brain morphology and cognition from The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) Challenge. Our results show the utility of JIVE analyses by obtaining summary measures of the signal shared in our morphometry and cognition measures are associated with Alzheimer’s diagnoses.'

  title: Large Scale Validation of the Spatial Bayesian General Linear Model for Cortical Surface fMRI Data
  abstract: 'Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data over a noninvasive measure 
  for interpreting neuronal processes in subjects in vivo at relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions. 
  Task fMRI is an imaging technique in which a subject is exposed to a stimulus, sometimes with an expected response, 
  in order to assess how the brain reacts. However, the signal-to-noise ratio in preprocessed task fMRI data 
  remains low, requiring innovative methods in order to provide the most statistical power possible. Bayesian spatial 
  methods allow for explicit, probabilistic definitions of the expected underlying signal spatial dependence,
  offering significant increases to model power through efficient use of available data. However, most such methods 
  analyze fMRI data that incorporate spatial dependencies via the locations in the brain represented as a volume. 
  Such models use distance-based dependence modeling using Euclidean distance, which can drastically distort 
  the geodesic distances along the folded cortex, resulting in oversmoothed activation amplitude estimates and reduced 
  power. An alternative is to examine data on the cortical surface, which allows for more accurate measures of 
  distance between data locations. A recent study proposed such a surface-based spatial Bayesian general 
  linear model (GLM) for task fMRI and showed improvements when estimating activation amplitude and determining areas of 
  significant brain activation. This promising study necessitates large scale validation in order to convincingly 
  demonstrate the value of the method to the broader neuroscience community. In this study, we validate the 
  surface-based spatial Bayesian GLM using a dataset of test-retest motor task data from the HCP. We assess the reliability 
  and power of individual and group-average task activations. In addition, we extend the surface-based spatial Bayesian 
  GLM to incorporate multiple runs in single-subject analyses. Comparisons to a classical massive "univariate" GLM for cortical surface 
  fMRI are included to show both improved power and reliability of the spatial Bayesian GLM.'

  title: Clustering brain extreme communities from multi-channel EEG data
  abstract: 'Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder affecting more than 50 million 
  people globally. An epileptic seizure acts like a temporary shock to the neuronal system, 
  disrupting normal electrical activity in the brain. Epilepsy is frequently diagnosed 
  with electroencephalograms (EEGs). Current cluster methods for characterizing brain 
  connectivity rely on the bulk of EEG distribution, such as coherence. Here, we use 
  a spherical k-means procedure based on extreme amplitudes of EEG signals during an 
  epileptic seizure. With this approach, cluster centers can be interpreted as extremal 
  prototypes, revealing the dependence structures of EEG channel communities. The way 
  cluster components relate to each other can be used as an exploratory tool to classify 
  EEG channels into asymptotic independents or asymptotic dependents. We illustrate the 
  use of this approach by an application to a real dataset from a patient with left temporal 
  lobe epilepsy.'

  title: 'SpLoc: Permutation-based spatial scanning for detecting fMRI group-level activation clusters'
  abstract: 'A new cluster-wise inference method, called SpLoc (“Spatially LOCalized signals”), is introduced to 
  detect statistically significant voxels/vertices in neuroimaging data. SpLoc increases (i) sensitivity by 
  taking the average of test statistics within each cluster defined by spatial neighbors and (ii) 
  specificity by pruning off clusters consisting mainly of the non-signal voxels based on the orderings 
  of the test statistics. It uses resampling approaches (sign-flipping/permutation) to estimate 
  potentially nonstationary spatial correlations and control family-wise error. We apply it to the taskfMRI 
  data from the Human Connectome Project and conduct simulation studies to address the 
  SpLoc’s performance compared to the existing methods.'

  title: The Spike-and-Slab Elastic Net as a Classification Tool in Alzheimer's Disease
  abstract: 'Alzheimer''s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and has received considerable
  research attention, including using neuroimaging biomarkers to classify patients and/or predict disease
  progression. Generalized linear models, e.g., logistic regression, can be used as classifiers, 
  but since the spatial measurements are correlated and often outnumber subjects, penalized and/or 
  Bayesian models will be identifiable, while classical models often will not. Many useful models,
  e.g., the elastic net and spike-and-slab lasso, perform automatic variable selection, which removes
  extraneous predictors and reduces model variance, but neither model exploits spatial information in
  selecting variables. Spatial information can be incorporated into variable selection by placing 
  intrinsic autoregressive priors on the logit probabilities of inclusion within a spike-and-slab elastic net 
  framework. We use cortical thickness and tau-PET images from the Alzheimer''s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
  (ADNI) study for binary classification of subjects who are cognitively normal, mildly cognitively 
  impaired, or diagnosed with dementia to demonstrate that this framework can improve classification performance.'

  title: Predicting the minimum number of sampling points needed to approximate shapes of planar contours via LINEX regression models
  abstract: 'Researchers in statistical shape analysis often analyze outlines of objects. Even though 
  these contours are infinite-dimensional in theory, they must be discretized in practice. 
  When discretizing, it is important to reduce the number of sampling points considerably 
  to reduce computational costs, but to not use too few points so as to result in too much 
  approximation error. Unfortunately, determining the minimum number of points needed 
  to sufficiently approximate the contours can be computationally expensive, itself. In this 
  paper, we fit regression models to predict these lower bounds using characteristics of the 
  contours that are computationally cheap as predictor variables. 
  However, least squares regression is inadequate for this task because it treats overestimation 
  and underestimation equally, but underestimation of lower bounds is far more 
  serious. Instead, to fit the models, we use the LINEX loss function, which allows us to 
  penalize underestimation at an exponential rate while penalizing overestimation only linearly. 
  We present six models to predict the lower bound of required sample points to 
  approximate the contours using two criteria with a given error threshold for three parameterizations. 
  Through validation methods, we show that these models work well in 
  many cases, even when predicting lower bounds for new categories of shapes, with low 
  approximation error.'

  title: Tensor response quantile regression with neuroimaging data
  abstract: 'Evaluating the impact of clinical factors on neuroimaging phenotypes is
  often of interest in neuroimaging studies. To this end, we propose a tensor response 
  quantile regression framework, where the neuroimaging phenotype is formulated as a tensor response and clinical 
  factors are allowed to have flexible heterogeneous effects on the tensor response. We develop 
  a computationally efficient estimation procedure for the regression coefficient tensor 
  associated with the covariate effects by imposing a sensible low-rank structure for the 
  coefficient tensor. This approach allows interpretable estimates of covariate effects regarding 
  the underlying structure of the neuroimaging phenotype. We establish the asymptotic 
  properties of the proposed estimators. Simulation studies demonstrate good finite-sample 
  performance of the proposed method. We apply the proposed methods to investigate the 
  association of post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD) clinical assessments and fMRI resting-state 
  functional connectivities in the Grady Trauma Project.'

  title: Multilevel hybrid principal components analysis for region-referenced multilevel functional EEG data
  abstract: 'Electroencephalography (EEG) experiments produce region-referenced functional
  data representing brain signals collected across the scalp. The data typically also has a multilevel 
  structure where the high-dimensional observations are collected across experimental conditions or multiple visits. 
  Common analysis of EEG reduces the data complexity by collapsing the functional and regional dimensions, 
  by analyzing specific event-related potential (ERP) features or specific frequency band power in a 
  pre-specified scalp region. This practice can fail to portray the more comprehensive differences in the 
  entire ERP signal or the power spectral density (PSD) across the entire scalp. The proposed multilevel 
  hybrid principal components analysis (M-HPCA) utilizes dimension reduction tools from both vector and 
  functional principal components analysis (based on weak separability of the high-dimensional covariance process)
  to decompose total variation into between and within subject components along both the functional and 
  regional dimensions. The proposed approach enables computationally efficient estimation and inference 
  through the use of a minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm to target model components coupled with a
  bootstrap procedure for inference. The diverse array of applications of M-HPCA is showcased with two real 
  data examples. While ERP responses to match vs. mismatch conditions are compared in an audio odd-ball 
  paradigm across typically developing (TD), minimally verbal and verbal children diagnosed with Autism 
  Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in the first example, reliability of the PSD of ASD and TD children collected 
  across visits that are only a week apart are compared in the second. Finite sample properties of the proposed 
  methodology are studied in extensive simulations.'

  title: Improving Functional Connectivity Estimates with Data-Driven Scrubbing
  abstract: 'Functional MRI data require careful pre-processing and denoising to reduce the effects of head 
  motion, scanner drift, respiration, heartbeat, thermal noise, and other sources of non-neuronal 
  variation. Denoising techniques typically fall into two categories: regression-based, which 
  remove components varying across the entire scan (e.g. slow scanner drift), and 
  scrubbing-based, which remove artifactual volumes (e.g. those concurrent with abrupt head 
  movement). Motion scrubbing and DVARS are popular scrubbing techniques, but motion 
  scrubbing only removes noise co-occurring with head motion, and DVARS only takes into 
  account deviation from the previous frame. Leverage scrubbing is a statistically-principled, 
  data-driven method for cleaning fMRI. It works by identifying directions in the data likely to 
  express artifacts. These directions are estimated by first performing independent (or principal) 
  component analysis, then retaining the components whose scores have kurtosis that statistically 
  exceeds what would be expected under the null of no outliers. Volumes (time points) that have high 
  scores associated with these retained components are likely to contain burst noise. We compute an overall
  leverage score (based on the regression concept) for each volume, which is thresholded to flag volumes for removal. 
  Using test-retest data from the Human Connectome Project, we compare the performance of 
  leverage scrubbing with two other scrubbing methods, framewise displacement (FD) and 
  DVARS. For each method, we assess the reliability of functional connectivity (FC) estimates, 
  the accuracy of predicting sex based on FC, and the identifiability of individual subjects based 
  on their FC. We find evidence that leverage-based scrubbing clearly outperforms motion 
  scrubbing based on all metrics. In general, leverage-based and DVARS-based scrubbing 
  improves the reliability and sex-predictiveness of FC, but has little effect on their identifiability.'

  title: Harmonization of Functional Connectivity Reduces Scanner Effects in Community Detection
  abstract: 'Community detection on graphs constructed via functional magnetic resonance imaging 
  (fMRI) scans has become an increasingly popular method for studying brain functional organization. 
  Similar to other studies involving neuroimaging data, studies of brain community 
  structure commonly acquire subjects on multiple scanners across different locations.
  Differences in scanner can introduce variability into the downstream results, often called scanner 
  effects. These effects have been previously shown to significantly impact common metrics 
  in brain network analyses. In this study, we identify substantial scanner effects in community
  detection results and relevant network metrics. We assess a known harmonization method and
  propose two additional methods for harmonization of functional connectivity. We demonstrate
  that our new methods perform well to remove scanner effects in community 
  structure and related metrics at both the scanner and subject level.'
