  title: A Novel Correlation based Co-localization Analysis of Super-resolution Images
  abstract: Super resolution imaging techniques have significantly improved the resolution of
  microscopic images from 250 to a few nanometers over the past decades, resulting in data format
  evolving from color intensity arrays to precise coordinated locations. Hence, new coordinate based
  statistical methods using precise locational information to study co localization of dual color
  spatial points in super resolution microscopy images are in high demand. In this study, we propose
  a new correlation based method, named Normalized Spatial Intensity Correlation ( NSInC , “in synch”),
  to quantify the degree of co localization with area based edge effect corrections which removes
  biasedness in the current available methods. Simulations and real applications are provided for
  illustrating the validity and applicability.

  title: Combining Batches of High-Dimensional Multiplexed Images
  abstract: 'High-dimensional multiplexed imaging methods can help quantify the heterogeneity of cell
populations in healthy and tumorous tissues, offering insight into tumor progression and
improved treatment strategies. However, implicit biases exist in the imaging pipeline - images
are distorted by optical effects, slide and batch effects, and instrument variability. Normalization
of this data is compounded by the number of markers and natural tissue variability within each
image, introducing systematic differences that impact inference. In this work, we introduce an
image normalization pipeline to reduce systematic variability in multiplexed images by correcting
for batch effects. We build on existing methods to compare the following approaches to correct
for the batch effects in the data: a logarithmic transformation, a simple standardization (division
by the mean), and approaches that adapt ComBat and functional data registration. We
demonstrate these methods by analyzing multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) images of
human colorectal tissue samples to quantify the reduction in variability of the data, namely using
thresholding methods and random effects models. We further demonstrate the method's ability
to retain biological signal by evaluating prediction accuracy of models for specific regions
containing tumors in the tissue samples.'

  title: PPA: Principal Parcellation Analysis for Brain Connectomes and Multiple Traits
  abstract: Our understanding of the structure of the brain and its
  relationships with human traits is largely determined by how we
  represent the structural connectome. Standard practice divides
  the brain into regions of interest (ROIs) and represents the
  connectome as an adjacency matrix having cells measuring
  connectivity between pairs of ROIs. Statistical analyses are then
  heavily driven by the (largely arbitrary) choice of ROIs. We
  propose a novel tractography-based representation of brain
  connectomes, which clusters fiber endpoints to define a data
  adaptive parcellation targeted to explain variation among
  individuals and predict human traits. This representation leads
  to Principal Parcellation Analysis (PPA), representing individual
  brain connectomes by compositional vectors building on a basis
  system of fiber bundles that captures the connectivity at the
  population level. PPA reduces subjectivity and facilitates
  statistical analyses. We illustrate the proposed approach
  through applications to data from the Human Connectome
  Project (HCP) and show that PPA connectomes improve power
  in predicting human traits over state-of-the-art methods based
  on classical connectomes while dramatically improving
  parsimony and maintaining interpretability.

  title: There is increasing evidence on the importance of brain morphology in 
  predicting and classifying mental disorders and behavior. However, most current 
  shape approaches rely heavily on vertex-wise analysis that may not successfully 
  capture complexities of subcortical structures. Additionally, the past works do not 
  include interactions between these structures and exposure factors when modeling 
  clinical or behavioral outcomes. Predictive modeling with such interactions is of
  paramount interest in heterogeneous mental disorders such as PTSD, where trauma 
  exposure and other factors interact with brain shape changes to influence behavior.
  We propose a comprehensive framework that overcomes these limitations by representing 
  brain substructures as continuous parameterized surfaces and quantifying their shape 
  differences using elastic shape metrics. Using the elastic shape metric, we compute 
  shape summaries (mean, covariance, PCs) of subcortical data and represent individual 
  shapes by their principal scores under a PCA basis. These representations allow 
  visualization tools that help understand localized changes when these PCs are varied. 
  Subsequently, these PCs, the auxiliary exposure variables, and their interactions are 
  used for regression modeling and prediction. We apply our method to data from the 
  Grady Trauma Project (GTP), where the goal is to predict clinical measures of PTSD 
  using shapes of brain substructures such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and putamen. Our 
  analysis revealed considerably greater predictive power under the elastic shape analysis 
  than widely used approaches such as the standard vertex-wise shape analysis and even a 
  volumetric analysis. It helped identify local deformations in brain shapes related to 
  change in PTSD severity. To our knowledge, this is one of the first brain shape analysis
  approaches that can seamlessly integrate the pre-processing steps under one umbrella for 
  improved accuracy and are naturally able to account for interactions between brain shape 
  and additional covariates to yield superior predictive performance when modeling clinical 
  outcomes. Interactive visualizations are available in the 
  GitHub repository (https://github.com/wuyx5/Elastic-Shape-Analysis-PTSD).

  title: Multi-scale Graph Principal Component Analysis for Connectomics
  abstract: In brain connectomics, it is common to divide the cortical surface 
  into discrete regions of interest (ROIs) and then to use these regions to induce a graph. 
  The structure of the resulting adjacency matrices depends critically on the chosen regions, 
  leading to dramatically different inference when different regions are chosen. To solve 
  this problem we develop a multi-scale graph model, which links together scale-specific 
  factorizations through common individual-specific latent factors. These scores combine information across 
  from different parcellations to produce a single interpretable summary of an individuals brain structure. We
  develop a simple, efficient algorithm, and illustrate substantial advantages over comparable 
  single-scale methods in both simulations and analyses of the Human Connectome Project dataset.

  title: Quantifying brain age prediction uncertainty from imaging using scalar-on-image quantile regression
  abstract: Prediction of subject age from brain anatomical MRI has the potential to provide a 
  sensitive summary of brain changes, indicative of different neurodegenerative diseases. 
  However, existing studies typically neglect the uncertainty of these predictions. In this work we 
  take into account this uncertainty by applying methods of functional data analysis. We propose
  a penalized functional quantile regression model of age on brain structure with cognitively
  normal (CN) subjects in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and
  use it to predict brain age in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease
  (AD) subjects. Unlike the machine learning approaches available in the literature of brain
  age prediction, which provide only point predictions, the outcome of our model is a prediction
  interval for each subject. The prediction accuracy obtained with this model is similar
  to more sophisticated approaches, while being also more principled and interpretable. The
  gap between predicted and chronological age correlates with cognitive decline.

  title: Outlier Detection for Multi-Network Data
  abstract: It has become routine in neuroscience studies to measure brain networks for 
  different individuals using neuroimaging. These networks are expressed as adjacency matrices, 
  with each cell containing a summary of connectivity between a pair of brain regions. There is 
  an emerging statistical literature describing methods for the analysis of such multi-network data
  in which nodes are common across networks, but the edges vary. However, such brain connectome 
  data often consist of outliers from various sources. First, the data can be corrupted by noise 
  from various sources during the data collection phase like physical movement of the subject during
  the scanning process. In addition, structural connectivity reconstruction is a complex process, 
  consisting of many steps and relying on many different open-source software suites. A small mistake
  in the pipeline (e.g., brain tissue segmentation error) will be propagated and amplified to the 
  final connectivity output. . For such individuals, the resulting adjacency matrix may be mostly 
  zeros or may exhibit a bizarre pattern not consistent with a normal brain network. Previous quality 
  controls of these pipelines heavily rely on man power through visualization of intermediate results,
  which is time consuming and impractical for large datasets such as UK Biobank. However, if not accounted 
  for carefully, the outlying connectomes can be influential in subsequent statistical analyses. We 
  propose a simple method for network outlier detection (NOD) relying on an approximation of the influence 
  function under a hierarchical generalized linear model for the adjacency matrices. Our NOD method is 
  illustrated through an application to data from the UK Biobank.
