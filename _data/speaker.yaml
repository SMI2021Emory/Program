  title: Inference for multiple heterogeneous networks with a common invariant subspace
  abstract: The development of models for multiple heterogeneous network data is of
    critical importance both in statistical network theory and across multiple application
    domains, including neuroscience. Although single-graph inference is well-studied,
    multiple graph inference is largely unexplored, in part because of the challenges
    inherent in appropriately modeling graph differences and yet retaining sufficient
    model simplicity to render estimation feasible. The common subspace independent-edge
    (COSIE) multiple random graph model addresses this gap, by describing a heterogeneous
    collection of networks with a shared latent structure on the vertices but potentially
    different connectivity patterns for each graph. The COSIE model is both flexible
    to account for important graph differences and tractable to allow for accurate
    spectral inference. The model can be deployed for a number of subsequent network
    inference tasks, including dimensionality reduction, classification, hypothesis
    testing, and community detection. Performance is demonstrated on a dataset of
    connectomes, showing an accurate classification of brain scans by patients and
    a meaningful determination of heterogeneity across different subjects.

  title: Extensions of ComBat for harmonization of multi-scanner neuroimaging data
    in an Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset
  abstract: While aggregation of neuroimaging datasets from multiple sites and scanners
    presents opportunities for larger sample sizes and increased statistical power,
    it also presents challenges due to systematic scanner effects. In this talk we
    present several recent extensions of ComBat (Combatting Batch Effects when Combining
    Batches), a harmonization method originally developed for genomics and later adapted
    to cross-sectional neuroimaging data. Specifically, we discuss ComBat extended
    to linear mixed effects models (longitudinal ComBat), generalized additive (mixed)
    models (ComBatGA(M)M), and harmonization of covariance (CovBat). Using structural
    MRI data from 663 participants in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
    (ADNI) study, we demonstrate the presence of scanner-related effects on the means,
    variances, and covariance of cortical thickness measures across brain atlas regions.
    We discuss situations where ComBat increases statistical power, helps control
    type I error rate, and yields better classification and prediction performance
    than unharmonized data.

  title: Covariance regression for connectome outcomes
  abstract: 'In this talk, we cover methodology for jointly analyzing a collection
    of covariance or correlation matrices that depend on other variables. This covariance-as-an-outcome
    regression problem arises commonly in the study of brain imaging, where the covariance
    matrix in question is an estimate of functional or structural connectivity. Two
    main approaches to covariance regression exists: outer product models and joint
    diagonalization approaches. We investigate joint diagonalization approaches and
    discuss the benefits and costs of this solution. We distinguish between diagonalization
    approaches where the eigenvectors are selected in the absence of covariate information
    and those that chose the eigenvectors so that the result regression model holds
    best. The methods are applied to resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging
    data in a study of aphasia and potential interventions.'

  title: Estimation of the Mean Function of Functional Data via Deep Neural Networks

    parameters by cross-validation.  Through Monte Carlo simulation studies we examine
    the finite-sample performance of the proposed method. Finally, the proposed method
    is applied to analyze positron emission tomography images of patients with Alzheimer

  title: Improving reproducibility in network modeling
  abstract: 'With the popular approach of massively univariate analysis in neuroimaging,
    one builds as many models as the number of elements, leading to a major contributor
    to the reproducibility crisis due to three intrinsic problems: 1) modeling inefficiency,
    2) artificial dichotomization, and 3) researcher degrees of freedom. We propose
    a Bayesian multilevel framework that incorporates all elements through global
    calibration in one integrative model. Statistical inferences at each element are
    thus achieved from the overall posterior distribution through Markov Chain Monte
    Carlo simulations. In addition, our framework incorporates multiplicity as an
    integral component of the modeling structure, not as a separate correction step.
    By turning multiplicity from an annoying penalty into a strength, we aim to achieve
    six goals: 1) improve model efficiency, 2) gain a higher predictive accuracy,
    3) control the errors of incorrect magnitude and incorrect sign instead of conventional
    false positives and false negatives, 4) validate each model relative to its competing
    candidates, 5) reduce the reliance on and the sensitivity to the choice of data
    space, and 6) promote full results reporting. Our modeling framework reverberates
    with recent proposals to abandon the dichotomization of statistical evidence (“significant”
    vs. “non-significant”), to improve the interpretability of research findings,
    as well as to encourage reporting the full gamut of results (not only “significant”
    ones), thereby enhancing research transparency and reproducibility.'

  title: l_0 shrinkage in graph space for brain network inference
  abstract: We consider group-level statistical inference for networks, where the
    outcome variables of each subject are multivariate edges in an adjacency matrix.
    We assume the nodes of adjacency matrices are identical across all subjects and
    the goal is to identify and statistically test whether edges in some subnetworks
    that are associated with the covariates of interest. We propose a group level
    network statistical framework to extract the subgraphs where edges are likely
    to be related to the covariate via $l_0$ norm regularization and perform statistical
    tests on the detected subgraphs by graph combinatorics. Theoretical properties
    of the novel objective function and network-level inference are provided. We apply
    the proposed method to a brain connectomic study to identify the subnetworks of
    brain-connectome that are associated with brain diseases. In addition, we perform
    extensive simulation studies. The results demonstrate the proposed method outperform
    existing multivariate statistical methods by simultaneously improve false positive
    and false negative discovery rates and significantly increase replicability.

  title: Multiple imputation in functional regression with applications to EEG data
    in a depression study
  abstract: Missing data are a common problem in biomedical research.  Valid approaches
    for addressing this problem have been proposed and are regularly implemented in
    applications where the data are exclusively scalar-valued.  With advances in technology
    and data storage, biomedical studies now frequently collect both scalar and functional
    data, both of which may be subject to missingness.  However, little work has been
    done to deal with missing functional data.  We propose extensions of multiple
    imputation and Rubin’s Rules for pooling estimates derived from multiply imputed
    data sets that accommodate both scalar and functional data. We present results
    from a simulation study showing the performance of our proposed approach with
    respect to fidelity to the observed data and estimation of the parameters of interest.  We
    also present results from applying our proposed approach in the context of fitting
    a function-on-scalar regression model relating characteristics derived from electroencephalography
    to depression status (major depressive disorder vs. healthy control).

  title: Bayesian Vector Autoregression using the Tree Rank Prior with an Application
    to fMRI Data Analysis
  abstract: Vector autoregression is very popular for analyzing the multivariate time
    series. Besides good predictive performance, it enjoys nice interpretation in
    the Granger-causality graph --- the past values of some variables are helpful
    for predicting the others. In the high dimensional setting with p variables, one
    often relies on the matrix-norm/matrix-rank based regularization to induce sparsity;
    however, this tends to create too many disconnected graph components that are
    difficult to interpret. To solve this problem, we propose a new type of low-rankness
    based on the graph topology --- we define the "tree rank" as the  number of spanning
    trees needed to cover the graph. Each spanning tree is a minimalist subgraph with
    (p-1) edges but connects p nodes. As the result, having the regression coefficients
    on a few spanning trees leads to both high sparsity and high connectivity. To
    allow efficient computation and uncertainty quantification on the estimates, we
    develop a novel graph-based continuous shrinkage prior, that exploits a continuous
    relaxation for the spanning trees. This prior, that we call "Tree Rank Prior",
    avoids the costly combinatorial search in the graph estimation and enjoys the
    gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm for its posterior estimation.
    We show that this model enjoys appealing theoretical properties, such as the mild
    stability conditions, posterior consistency, as well as useful information retrieval
    even under model misspecification. The model is applied to find the Granger causality
    graph in the functional magnetic resonance imaging data.

  title: Analysis of structural imaging data in cancer
  abstract: Cancer patients routinely undergo radiological evaluations when images
    of various modalities including computed tomography, positron emission tomography,
    and magnetic resonance images are collected for diagnosis and for evaluation of
    disease progression. Tumor characteristics, often referred to as measures of "tumor
    heterogeneity", can be computed using these clinical images and used as predictors
    of disease progression and patient survival. Several approaches to quantifying
    tumor heterogeneity have been proposed including simple intensity histogram-based
    measures, metrics attempting to quantify average distance from a homogeneous surface,
    and texture analysis-based methods. I will present a statistical framework for
    estimating tumor heterogeneity using clustering methods taking into account the
    topology of the tumors. The proposed approach incorporates the spatial structure
    of the tumor image using neighborhood summary measures. In addition, I will describe
    a principal manifold estimation approach for estimating the surface of cancer
    tumors using a smooth surface.

  title: In vivo metabolic imaging with magnetic resonance spectroscopy

  title: The clinical translation of QSM as a new imaging biomarker for disease progression
    and treatment response in Multiple Sclerosis
  abstract: Chronic CNS inflammation in the multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions is maintained
    with iron-containing pro-inflammatory microglia and macrophages at the rim of
    chronic active MS lesions. Histologically, these lesions demonstrate ongoing demyelination
    and expansion, which may play an essential role in the pathogenesis of progressive
    clinical decline. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an imaging technique
    that provides efficient in vivo quantification of susceptibility changes related
    to iron deposition.  We have demonstrated that QSM can detect iron at MS lesion
    rims and have provided in-vivo validation that these lesions have more inflammation
    and tissue damage. We have also demonstrated that QSM rim lesions (rim+) have
    a temporal trajectory with an increase and subsequent decrease in susceptibility,
    which is consistent with the transition from a chronic active to a chronic inactive
    lesion.  We have preliminary data demonstrating the influence of rim+ lesions
    on clinical disability, including cognition, promoting the potential for QSM as
    a tool to understand mechanisms of injury leading to disease progression. Our
    next stage is to determine the utility of QSM as a biomarker for treatment response.
    Monitoring chronic MS lesions in response to treatment would provide a novel and
    essential therapeutic strategy to reduce tissue injury, neuronal degeneration
    and clinical disability.

  title: Bayesian Regression with Undirected Network Predictors with an Application
    to Brain Connectome Data
  abstract: This article focuses on the relationship between a measure of creativity
    and the human brain network of subjects from a brain connectome dataset obtained
    using a diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) procedure. We identify
    brain regions and interconnections between them that have a significant effect
    on the creativity. Brain networks are often expressed in terms of symmetric adjacency
    matrices, with row and column indices of the matrix representing the regions of
    interest (ROI), and a cell entry signifying the estimated number of fiber bundles
    connecting the corresponding row and column ROIs. Current statistical practices
    for regression analysis with the brain network as the predictor and the measure
    of creativity as the response typically vectorize the network predictor matrices
    prior to any analysis, thus failing to account for the important structural information
    in the network. This results in poor inferential and predictive performance. To
    answer the scientific questions above, this article develops a flexible Bayesian
    framework that avoids reshaping the network predictor matrix, draws inference
    on the brain ROIs and interconnections between ROIs significantly related to creativity
    and enables accurate prediction of creativity from a brain network. A novel class
    of network shrinkage priors for the coefficient corresponding to the network predictor
    is proposed to achieve these inferential goals simultaneously. The principled
    Bayesian framework allows precise characterization of the uncertainty in detecting
    an ROI as influential for creativity, as well as the quantification of uncertainty
    in prediction of creativity from a network predictor. Empirical results in simulation
    studies illustrate substantial inferential and predictive gains of the proposed
    framework in comparison with competitors. Our framework yields new insights into
    the relationship of brain regions with creativity, also providing the uncertainty
    associated with the scientific findings.

    of the form E[Y|X,Z] = X*beta + Z*b, where the response variable y corresponds
    to a neuropsychological outcome, X are the possible confounders, and Z are the
    explanatory variables (e.g. cortical thickness or area) for which the functional
    and structural connectivity information exists. The connectivity information is
    used to build the adaptive penalty terms in the regularized regression problem.
    The general idea of incorporating connectivity information in regularization approach
    via linear mixed model representation has been recently established in our prior
    work: ridgified Partially Empirical Eigenvectors for Regression (riPEER). Here,
    we incorporate multiple sources of information, e.g. functional connectivity network
    structure, and estimate the regression parameters with multiple penalty terms

  title: Integrative fused mean structure learning with application to image-on-scalar regression
  abstract: Motivated by image-on-scalar regression with data aggregated across multiple sites, we consider a setting in which multiple independent studies each collect multiple dependent vector 
  outcomes, with potential mean model parameter homogeneity between studies and outcome vectors. To 
  determine the validity of jointly analyzing these data sources, we must learn which of these data 
  sources share mean model parameters. We propose a new model fusion approach that delivers improved 
  flexibility, statistical performance and computational speed over existing methods. Our proposed 
  approach specifies a quadratic inference function within each data source and fuses mean model parameter 
  vectors in their entirety based on a new formulation of a pairwise fusion penalty. We also propose 
  an asymptotically equivalent weighted oracle meta-estimator that is more computationally efficient 
  and privacy preserving. Simulations and application to amplitude of low frequency fluctuations data 
  from the ABIDE neuroimaging consortium highlight the flexibility of the proposed approach.

  title: Shape-on-Vector Geodesic Regression Model and Its Applications in Image Data
    Analysis
  abstract: With the rapid growth of modern technology, many large-scale biomedical
    studies have been conducted to collect massive datasets with large volumes of
    complex information from increasingly large cohorts. Among these collected images,
    they usually contain objects of interest (e.g., regions of interest, ROIs) and
    the major goal is to understand and analyze shapes of these objects in larger
    biological systems. Due to the complexity of disease progression and mis-registration
    in image preprocessing, shapes can significantly vary across subjects and distinct
    shape patterns are more likely to be found within the same patient group. Therefore,
    understanding such shape heterogeneity is critical for the development of urgently
    needed approaches to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of these diseases,
    and precision medicine broadly. In order to address this challenge, in this talk,
    several shape-on-vector regression models are established for heterogeneous imaging
    data with different structures. This is a joint work with Dr. Anuj Srivastava.

  title: Bayesian Inferences in EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interface via the Split-and-Merge
    Gaussian Process
  abstract: A brain-computer interface (BCI) refers to a system that uses brain activity
    to control or communicate with technology.  In particular, BCIs can help people
    with disabilities use technology for communication. The fundamental statistical
    problem in BCI is classification. A common design for an electroencephalogram
    (EEG) BCI relies on classification of the P300 event-related potential (ERP),
    which is a response elicited by the rare occurrence of target stimuli among common
    non-target stimuli. Many machine learning methods have constructed P300 ERP-based
    classifiers, but few provide insights on the underlying mechanism of the neural
    activity. In this work, we propose a new Bayesian generative method to model the
    conditional distribution of the EEG signals given our EEG-BCI design, from which
    the predictive probability of brain signals can be derived. Our method focuses
    on detecting spatial-temporal differences where the EEG signals have strong predictive
    powers, providing an understanding of the neural activity in response to external
    stimuli. Extensive simulation studies and analysis of real participants show the
    advantages of the proposed method compared to previous methods.

  title: Adaptive Spectral Analysis of High-Dimensional EEG with Application to Monitoring
    Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation during Psychosis
  abstract: Motivated by the analysis of high-density EEG (hdEEG), in this talk we
    discuss a nonparametric approach to spectral analysis of a high-dimensional multivariate
    nonstationary time. The procedure is based on a novel frequency-domain factor
    model that provides a flexible yet parsimonious representation of spectral matrices
    from a large number of simultaneously observed time series. Real and imaginary
    parts of the factor loading matrices are modeled independently using a prior that
    is formulated from the tensor product of penalized splines and multiplicative
    gamma process shrinkage priors, allowing for infinitely many factors with loadings
    increasingly shrunk towards zero as the column index increases. Formulated in
    a fully Bayesian framework, the time series is adaptively partitioned into approximately
    stationary segments, where both the number and location of partition points are
    assumed unknown. Stochastic approximation Monte Carlo (SAMC) techniques are used
    to accommodate the unknown number of segments, and a conditional Whittle likelihood-based
    Gibbs sampler is developed for efficient sampling within segments.  By averaging
    over the distribution of partitions, the proposed method can approximate both
    abrupt and slowly varying changes in spectral matrices.  The method is used to
    analyze hdEEG from a patient receiving transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
    while hospitalized for a first-break psychotic episode.

  title: Visualization and Outlier Detection for Shape Data
  abstract: We propose a new method for the construction and visualization of geometrically-motivated
    boxplot displays for elastic curve data. We use a recent shape analysis framework,
    based on the square-root velocity function representation of curves, to extract
    different sources of variability from elastic curves, which include location,
    scale, shape, orientation and parametrization. We then focus on constructing separate
    displays for these various components using the Riemannian geometry of their representation
    spaces. This involves computation of a median, two quartiles, and two extremes
    based on geometric considerations. The outlyingness of an elastic curve is also
    defined separately based on each of the five components. We evaluate the proposed
    methods using multiple simulations, and then focus our attention on real data
    applications. In particular, we study variability in (a) 3D spirals, (b) handwritten
    signatures, (c) 3D fibers from diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging, and
    (d) trajectories of the Lorenz system. This work was done in collaboration with

    the number of mediators. Most existing mediation inference solutions either explicitly
    impose that the mediators are conditionally independent given the exposure, or
    ignore any potential directed paths among the mediators. In this talk, we present
    a new hypothesis testing procedure to evaluate individual mediation effects, while
    taking into account potential interactions among the mediators. Our key idea is
    to construct the test statistic using the logic of Boolean matrices, which enables
    us to establish the proper limiting distribution under the null hypothesis. We
    further employ screening, data splitting, and decorrelated estimation to reduce
    the bias and increase the power of the test. We show that our test can control
    both the size and false discovery rate asymptotically, and the power of the test
    approaches one, while allowing the number of mediators to diverge to infinity
    with the sample size. We illustrate our method with two applications in neuroimaging-based
    mediation analysis for Alzheimer's disease.

  title: Inter-modal Coupling for Multi-modal Image Analysis
  abstract: Local cortical coupling is a subject-specific measure of the spatially
    varying relationship between cortical thickness and sulcal depth. Although it
    is a promising first step towards understanding local covariance patterns between
    two image-derived measurements, a more general coupling framework that can accommodate
    multiple volumetric imaging modalities is warranted. We first introduce Inter-Modal
    Coupling (IMCo), an analogue of local coupling in volumetric space that can be
    used to produce subject-level, spatially varying feature maps derived from two
    volumetric imaging modalities. We then leverage IMCo to address partial volume
    effects when studying localized relationships between gray matter density and
    cerebral blood flow (CBF) among participants in the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental
    Cohort. We also develop a generalized estimating equation approach to study spatial
    variation in multi-modal image relationships at the population level.

  title: Towards an Automatic Detection Method of Chronic Active Lesions in Multiple
    Sclerosis
  abstract: Recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have shown that
    chronic active multiple sclerosis lesions can be assessed in vivo by a hypointense
    rim of iron deposits around the border of a white matter lesion. These lesions
    are typically characterized by a dark rim indicating increased iron-laden microglia/macrophages
    at their edge, and their presence is associated with worse disease outcomes. In
    this project, we present some candidate methods for the automatic detection of
    these rims on 3T-weighted MRI images, specifically on T2*-phase images, a byproduct
    of the T2* imaging sequence. The first method extracts radiomic features from
    the phase images and aims to predict rim presence on the lesion level. The second
    quantifies the covariance structure of multi-modal images via inter-modal coupling
    analysis, and the third method aims to identify these rims with intensity gradients,
    both of which aim to predict rim presence on the voxel level.

  title: Covariate Assisted Principal Regression for Covariance Matrix Outcomes with
    an Application to fMRI
  abstract: Modeling variances in data has been an important topic in many fields,
    including in financial and neuroimaging analysis. We consider the problem of regressing
    covariance matrices on vector covariates, collected from each observational unit.
    The main aim of this paper is to uncover the variation in the covariance matrices
    across units that are explained by the covariates. This paper introduces Covariate
    Assisted Principal (CAP) regression, an optimization-based method for identifying
    the components predicted by (generalized) linear models of the covariates. We
    develop computationally efficient algorithms to jointly search the linear projections
    of the covariance matrices as well as the regression coefficients, and we establish
    the asymptotic properties. Using extensive simulation studies, our method shows
    higher accuracy and robustness in coefficient estimation than competing methods.
    Applied to a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study, our approach
    identifies the human brain network changes associated with age and sex.

  title: Leveraging shared population and spatial information for accurate estimation
    of subject-level brain networks
  abstract: Accurate, reliable fMRI-based measures of functional brain organization and connectivity at the subject level are greatly needed to advance fMRI-based research and translation to clinical care.  Such individual-level insights would allow researchers to deepen understanding of disease, disorders, development and aging, to build imaging-based biomarkers for disease classification, and to impact clinical care.  A common approach used to estimate spatial functional brain organization and functional connectivity is independent component analysis (ICA), wherein independent components (ICs) are spatial maps of the brain that represent functionally coherent regions.  Unfortunately, the low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI data makes accurate estimation of ICs and their functional connectivity (FC) challenging.  The existence of big fMRI datasets provides an opportunity to establish computationally advantageous empirical prior distributions for use in Bayesian models.  Additionally, recent advances in spatial and Bayesian statistics now make it possible to efficiently and effectively pool information shared across the cortical surface and other grey matter regions, leading to much more accurate estimation over models that implicitly or explicitly assume spatial independence.  We combine these two approaches–pooling over subjects and space–to obtain accurate estimates of subject-level brain networks based on independent component analysis (ICA). Spatial template ICA is a hierarchical Bayesian ICA framework for single-subject brain network organization that uses empirical population priors or "templates", as well as spatial priors on subject effects.  The population priors are spatially varying, providing more shrinkage toward the population in areas of the brain where subjects are similar and more flexibility in areas where they tend to differ.  Spatial template ICA provides a statistically principled alternative to ad-hoc approaches like dual regression, while retaining its primary benefits: subject-level component estimates are matched to existing group-level IC's, and it is applicable to new subjects not included in the original group ICA. Additionally, standard template ICA (without spatial priors) is very fast to estimate.  In contrast to dual regression, template ICA can also estimate subject-specific components representing additional brain networks or sources of noise, thereby avoiding contamination of the components of interest.  Through simulation studies and a reliability study based on data from the Human Connectome Project, we find that the use of empirical population priors substantially improves estimation efficiency, and the use of spatial priors further enhances efficiency and power.  We also present an application of the proposed methods to a study of the effects of psilocybin (a prodrug compound found in mushrooms) to organization and connectivity of the thalamus. The proposed methods are implemented in the R package templateICAr.

  title: Composite-hybrid basis approach incorporating residual connectivity in task
    fMRI data
  abstract: 'Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are a
    powerful tool to understand human sensory, cognitive, and emotional processes.
    The fMRI measurement consist of an indirect and non-invasive measure of brain
    activity based on the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast. A critical
    challenge is to account for the dependencies from the complex structure of the
    brain. In this talk, I propose an adaptive composite-hybrid basis approach to
    model task fMRI data. The proposed basis approach tackles the high-dimensionality
    inherent to the brain data while simultaneously accounting for nearby and distant
    spatial correlation in a multilevel basis procedure. The first level accounts
    for whitin-ROI spatial correlation by selecting a sparse set of bases for each
    ROI. The second level considers between-ROIs correlation and obtains a set of
    basis functions that represents the entire brain spatial structure. The third
    level of the approach models time dependencies in the BOLD time series by projecting
    the time course into a wavelet space and then  assuming a long memory process
    that accounts for differences in each wavelet decomposition level.  Moreover,
    residual connectivity between ROIs is incorporated into the estimation procedure
    and can provide further insights into fMRI tasks. The spatial strategy gives us
    a sparse representation of the brain improving many folds in computational speed
    and effectively providing full Bayesian inference at the voxel or ROI level. '

  title: 'RADIOHEAD: Radiogenomic Analysis incorporating tumor heterogeneity in imaging
    through densities'
  abstract: Recent technological advancements have enabled detailed investigation
    of associations between the molecular architecture and morphological heterogeneity
    of tumors, through multi-source integration of radiological imaging and genomic
    (radiogenomic) data. We integrate and harness radiogenomic data in patients with
    lower grade gliomas (LGG), a type of brain cancer, in order to develop a formal
    regression framework called RADIOHEAD (RADIOgenomic analysis incorporating tumor
    HEterogeneity in imAging through Densities) for modelling association between
    them. Imaging data is represented through voxel intensity probability density
    functions of tumor sub-regions obtained from multimodal magnetic resonance imaging,
    and genomic data through molecular signatures in the form of pathway enrichment
    scores corresponding to their gene expression profiles. Employing a Riemannian-geometric
    framework for principal component analysis on the set of probability density functions,
    we map each probability density to a vector of principal component scores, which
    are then included as predictors in a Bayesian regression model with the pathway
    enrichment scores as the response. Variable selection compatible with the grouping
    structure amongst the predictors induced through the tumor sub-regions is carried
    out under a group spike-and-slab prior. A Bayesian false discovery rate mechanism
    is then used to infer statistically significant associations based on the posterior
    distribution of the regression coefficients. Our analyses reveal several pathways,
    relevant to LGG etiology (such as synaptic transmission, nerve impulse and neurotransmitter
    pathways), to have significant associations with the corresponding imaging-based
    predictors.

  title: Connectivity Regression
  abstract: Assessing heterogeneity of multivariate associations across covariates
    is an important problem in many areas of modern science, including in neuroscience
    to discover factors explaining intersubject variability in functional connectivity
    networks.  In this work, we present general methodological framework to regress
    subject-specific networks on a set of covariates that produces multiplicity-adjusted
    hypothesis tests for which covariates affect the networks, as well as statistical
    measures indicating which network edges are driving these differences.  Our strategy
    involves projecting a subject-specific empirical correlation matrix into the Fisher
    correlation space using a matrix logarithm transform, which ensures positive-semidefiniteness
    and justifies Gaussian modeling.  Using a Gaussian multivariate regression framework
    in this space with cutting-edge sparsity priors, we regress the networks on predictors
    while discovering and accounting for second-order dependence across network edges
    which we show leads to greater efficiency and power for statistical inference
    using the principles of Seemingly Unrelated Regression.  We apply our approach
    to analyze functional connectivity networks of 1003 healthy young patients taken
    from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), finding subject-specific connectivity
    is associated with their post central gyrus area, precuneus area, and language
    processing capabilities.  Overall, our framework serves as a promising tool for
    solving problems in functional connectivity and addresses a growing need for performing
    inference on observations with complex structure.

  abstract: A primary goal of precision medicine is to make efficient use of data
    gathered at the time a patient presents for treatment, including imaging and other
    high-dimensional data, to select the optimal treatment for each patient.  We present
    a functional additive regression model, uniquely constrained to represent the

    large number of pretreatment functional covariates on a response variable, while
    allowing the marginal effects of the covariates to remain unspecified.  This method
    simultaneously selects functional/scalar treatment effect modifiers that exhibit
    possibly nonlinear interactions with the treatment indicator and that are relevant
    for making optimal treatment decisions.  We present theoretical properties of
    the proposed method and demonstrate its performance on both simulated and real

  title: Exploring Non-Linear Spectral Interactions in Multivariate Time Series
  abstract: Advances in imaging technology have given neuroscientists unprecedented
    access to examine various facets of how the brain “works”. Brain activity is complex.
    A full understanding of brain activity requires careful study of its multi-scale
    spatial-temporal organization (from neurons to regions of interest; and from transient
    events to long-term temporal dynamics). Motivated by these challenges, we will
    explore some characterizations of dependence between components of a multivariate
    time series and then apply these to the study of brain functional connectivity.  This
    is potentially interesting for brain scientists because functional brain networks
    are associated with cognitive function and mental and neurological diseases. There
    is no single measure of dependence that can capture all facets of brain connectivity.
    In this talk, we shall present some new models for exploring potential non-linear
    cross-frequency interactions. These interactions include the impact of phase of
    one oscillatory activity in one component on the amplitude of another oscillation.
    The proposed approach captures lead-lag relationships and hence can be used as
    a general framework for spectral causality.  This is joint work with Marco Pinto
    (KAUST and Oslo Metropolitan University).

  title: Correlation Tensor Decomposition and Its Application in Spatial Imaging Data
  abstract: In this paper, motivated by the multimodal optical imaging data in a breast
    cancer study, we propose a new correlation tensor learning approach to analyze
    spatial-correlated imaging data. Specifically, we construct a higher-order correlation
    tensor which effectively represents the spatial information and captures the pixel-wise
    correlation structure. In addition, we propose a new semi-symmetric tensor decomposition
    to model spatial correlations, which enables us to identify spatial correlation
    structures associated with disease, and thus improves the diagnostic power. We
    also establish the theoretical properties for estimation consistency and classification
    consistency incorporating spatial correlation and develop scalable computational
    algorithm. We illustrate the performance of the proposed method in both simulation
    studies and the application to optical breast cancer imaging data. The numerical
    results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other competing methods
    including the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is joint work with Yujia
    Deng and Xiwei Tang.

  title: Correcting Site Differences in the Covariance Structures of Neuroimaging
    Data
  abstract: With the increasing needs for big data analytics in medical imaging, pooling
    and integrating data from multi-site studies has become critical. Yet site differences
    attributed to various sources including differences in scanner manufacturers,
    acquisition and preprocessing protocols are known to exist and might have substantial
    impact towards the analytic results. Recently, batch-effect corrections methods
    such as ComBat (Johnson et al. 2007; Fortin et al., 2017) have been successfully
    adapted to remove scanner and site differences in neuroimaging data in many large-scale
    studies. However, the existing methods have mostly been focusing on correcting
    the mean shifts and scale differences for individual dimension across sites. However,
    we demonstrate that the remaining site differences after applying the existing
    harmonization techniques could hinder the performance of multivariate pattern
    analysis (MVPA). This poses a concern in validities of multivariate testing as
    well as analyses for functional connectivity where the focus is on estimating
    the dependency structures between regions. We propose CovBat, a novel approach
    that extends ComBat and utilizes covariance decomposition to remove the unwanted
    spatially-dependent site deviations in the covariance structures. Further developments
    have been focusing on preserving the biologically-relevant variations by accounting
    for related covariates effects in the covariance for functional connectivity analysis.
    We will demonstrate the performance of the methods using data from ADNI and ABCD
    studies.

    sclerosis (MS) lesions and their longitudinal behavior have the potential to serve
    as a biomarker of chronic inflammation and to be utilized to monitor disease progression
    and evaluate disease-modifying therapies. Here we introduce the image analysis
    tools that will enable us to use QSM rim+ lesions for this purpose: an automated
    method for identifying QSM lesion type and methods for determining the accurate
    inflammatory stage or age of a lesion.  We first introduce an automated algorithm
    for identifying QSM rim+ MS lesions in order to reduce the bias and burden of
    manual identification. This algorithm utilizes first-order radiomic features calculated
    over a lesion and a random forest classification model to classify lesions as
    QSM rim+. In a validation set, the algorithm obtained an area under the receiver

    lesion in both cross sectional and longitudinal settings.   This is crucial for
    evaluating the impact of disease-modifying therapies on the longitudinal behavior
    of these lesions, as temporal misalignment of lesions may obscure treatment effects.
    We first introduce a random forest model using radiomic features from multi-sequence
    MRI to classify lesions as less than a year or greater than a year old in a cross-sectional
    setting.  In a validation set we obtain an AUC of 0.89 and an accuracy of 82%.  We

  abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging

    and a neuraradiological study of accuracy of AD related ROI segmentations, were

    data from different sites/scanners should be properly addressed.

    with Applications to ERP Analysis
  abstract: Stationary points embedded in the derivatives are often critical for a
    model to be interpretable and may be considered as key  features of interest in
    many applications. We propose a semiparametric Bayesian model to efficiently infer
    the locations of stationary points  of a nonparametric function, while treating
    the function itself as a  nuisance parameter. We use Gaussian processes as a flexible
    prior for  the underlying function and impose derivative constraints to control  the
    function's shape via conditioning. We illustrate the proposed  methods using simulations
    and then apply the method to the estimation  of event-related potentials (ERP)
    derived from electroencephalography  (EEG) signals. We show how the proposed method
    automatically  identifies characteristic components and their latencies at the  individual
    level, avoiding the excessive averaging across subjects  which is routinely done
    in the field to obtain smooth curves. By  applying this approach to EEG data collected
    from younger and older  adults during a speech perception task, we are able to
    demonstrate how  the time course of speech perception processes change with age.

  title: Intensity warping for multisite MRI harmonization
  abstract: In multisite neuroimaging studies there is often unwanted technical variation
    across scanners and sites. These scanner effects can hinder detection of biological
    features of interest, produce inconsistent results, and lead to spurious associations.
    We assess scanner effects in two brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies
    where subjects were measured on multiple scanners within a short time frame, so
    that one could assume any differences between images were due to technical rather
    than biological effects. We propose mica (multisite image harmonization by CDF
    alignment), a tool to harmonize images taken on different scanners by identifying
    and removing within-subject scanner effects. Our goals in the present study were
    to (1) establish a method that removes scanner effects by leveraging multiple
    scans collected on the same subject, and, building on this, (2) develop a technique
    to quantify scanner effects in large multisite trials so these can be reduced
    as a preprocessing step. We found that unharmonized images were highly variable
    across site and scanner type, and our method effectively removed this variability
    by warping intensity distributions. We further studied the ability to predict
    intensity harmonization results for a scan taken on an existing subject at a new
    site using cross-validation.

  title: Surface-Based Connectivity Integration
  abstract: 'The integration of structural (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) remains
    a necessary and challenging frontier for neuroscience research due to signal and
    image processing limitations. Diffusion (dMRI) and resting-state functional MRI
    (rs-fMRI) provide the signals in white (WM) and gray matter (GM) for SC and FC.  The
    integration of structural and functional connectivity thus far has been limited
    to atlas-based parcellation studies. We present a novel atlas-free processing
    pipeline and some analysis methods to explore the integration of structural and
    functional connectivity at high spatial resolution. This processing pipeline overcomes
    a few important limitations: 1. it utilizes the geometry of the brain to impose
    prior knowledge, allowing all white matter fibers to end on the WM-GM surfaces;
    2. it smoothes the sparse SC into a dense one for a better comparison with FC.  The
    pipeline also outputs a new biomarker that can be used to study various clinical
    questions - the integrity/correlation between FC and SC at each vertex on the
    WM-GM surface. We will demonstrate this pipeline using a few healthy subjects.'

  title: Generalizing liquid association for multimodal neuroimaging
  abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading form of dementia, and the number
    of affected people is drastically increasing along with aging of the worldwide
    population. A key question of AD research is to understand the spatial associative
    patterns between two pathological proteins, amyloid-beta and tau, as the subject’s
    age varies. The problem can be formulated as studying the associations of two
    sets of random variables conditional on the third set of random variables, a topic
    that has received relatively little attention in the statistics literature, but
    is crucial for multimodal neuroimaging analysis in general. In this article, motivated
    by a multimodal positron emission tomography (PET) study for AD, we extend the
    notion of liquid association of K.C. Li (2002) from the univariate setting to
    the multivariate and high-dimensional setting. We propose a novel generalized
    liquid association analysis approach, which offers a new and unique angle to study
    associations among three sets of random variables. We establish a population dimension
    reduction model, transform the problem to sparse Tucker decomposition of a three-way
    tensor, and develop a higher-order singular value decomposition estimation algorithm.
    We derive the non-asymptotic error bound and asymptotic consistency of the proposed
    estimator, while allowing the variable dimensions to be larger than and diverge
    with the sample size. We analyze the motivating multimodal PET dataset, and identify
    important brain regions that exhibit the most contrastive associations as age
    varies. We further complement the data analysis with additional simulations to
    demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

  title: Penalized multi-state models for examining multimodal imaging signatures
    of Alzheimer's disease.
  abstract: Identifying antemortem biomarkers for progression from mild cognitive
    impairment (MCI) to dementia of Alzheimer‘s type is crucial to detect areas particularly
    sensitive to neurodegeneration caused by Alzheimer’s disease (AD), in addition
    to potentially providing a strong diagnostic tool at early disease stages. Jointly
    modeling the multiple states including normal control, MCI, and dementia as well
    as the transition probability between them provides a new approach to unravel
    the mechanism underlying the clinical progression of AD with enhanced statistical
    power. To deal with a large number of imaging features, we incorporate penalization
    in multi-state Markov transition models to select predictive imaging signatures
    of AD. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach using MRI and metabolism
    FDG-PET imaging data from the ADNI project.

  title: Imaging Genetics Analysis under Brain Connectivity with Application on Human
    Connectome Project
  abstract: With the availability of large-scale brain imaging and genetics data,
    brain imaging genetics, which studies the relationship between genetic variations
    and brain imaging phenotypes, is becoming an emerging and rapidly growing research
    field. Among different imaging quantitative traits, brain connectivity/network
    is the one plays an essential role to shape physiological and pathological behaviors
    as well as brain functional or structural composition. However, there are still
    limited works investigate the impact of genetic variants on brain connectivity
    and the existing ones typically broke down the contingency matrix via vectorization,
    ignoring the natural network structure. In this work, we developed a biologically
    interpretable network response regression under a proposed Bayesian hierarchical
    shrinkage prior. Our model incorporated the LD information within SNPs as well
    as the population brain network to better understand which and how genotypes impact
    the individual level brain connectivity. We also develop an efficient EM algorithm
    which scales up our method to analyze the whole brain network. We applied our
    method to Human Connectome Project (HCP).

  title: Multimodal Neuroimaging Data Integration and Pathway Analysis.
  abstract: With fast advancements in technologies, the collection of multiple types
    of measurements on a common set of subjects is becoming routine in science. Some
    notable examples include multi- modal neuroimaging studies for the simultaneous
    investigation of brain structure and function, and multi-omics studies for combining
    genetic and genomic information. Integrative analysis of multimodal data allows
    scientists to interrogate new mechanistic questions. However, the data collection
    and generation of integrative hypotheses is outpacing available methodology for
    joint analysis of multimodal measurements. In this article, we study high-dimensional
    multimodal data integration in the context of mediation analysis. We aim to understand
    the roles different data modalities play as possible mediators in the pathway
    between an exposure variable and an outcome. We propose a mediation model framework
    with two data types serving as separate sets of mediators, and develop a penalized
    optimization approach for parameter estimation. We study both the theoretical
    properties of the estimator through an asymptotic analysis, and its finite-sample
    performance through simulations. We illustrate our method with a multimodal brain
    pathway analysis having both structural and functional connectivities as mediators
    in the association between sex and language processing.

  title: Time-frequency Spectral Analysis of Scalp EEG signals using Empirical Mode
    Decomposition
  abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is an electrophysiological monitoring method
    to record electrical activity of the brain from different electrodes placed on
    scalp. In this talk, we propose an effective data-driven processing pipeline to
    first clean, decompose the scalp EEG signals, and perform time-frequency analysis
    using Hilbert-Huang transform, and further build machine learning classifiers.
    Specifically, we propose to decompose a EEG signal into a set of Intrinsic Mode
    Functions (IMFs) using a data-driven method named Empirical Mode Decomposition
    (EMD). For each IMF, we obtain the instantaneous frequency and amplitude through
    Hilbert transform. Then we propose a new metric to measure the frequency component
    of each IMF and further select the IMF to represent certain brain wave. We also
    propose a metric to measure the averaged amplitude of certain brain wave. Using
    the proposed metrics, we can test some cognitive hypothesis, as well as build
    machine learning classifiers. Specifically, we first train a between task classifier
    using Random Forest to successfully classify four tasks with 99.12% accuracy in
    average, and further build within task classifiers to classify body/eye movements
    for each task with at least 94.47% accuracy.
