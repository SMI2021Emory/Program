# Gather.Town

The poster session and opening mixer will be held in a virtual space via gather.town. The two-hour session will be divided into two parts: the first hour is for the poster session (5-6pm) and the second hour is for the mixer session (6-7pm). In the poster session, the poster presenters with odd poster number will be required to stay at their poster for the first half hour (5pm - 5:30pm), while presenters with even poster number will be required to stay at their poster for the second half hour (5:30pm - 6pm). Outside the specific time slots, the presenters can choose to stay at their poster or walk around to view other posters. The poster room, with poster numbers, is displayed below:

The mixer room can be seen below. This room includes a main podium for making announcements to the entire group, as well as many smaller spaces for small group conversations.
