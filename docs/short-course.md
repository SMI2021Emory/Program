### Introduction to Deep Learning 

Deep Learning is ubiquitous today across data-driven applications as diverse as machine vision, natural language processing, and super-human game-playing. This half-day workshop will introduce the fundamentals of the main types of deep learning models.  You will also learn the motivation and use cases of deep learning through hands-on exercises using R and Python in the cloud environment. This workshop is designed for the audience with a statistics background. No software download or installation is needed, everything is done through an internet browser (Chrome or Firefox) in Databricks free cloud environment.

Topics:

* Feedforward Neural Networks
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Recurrent Neural Networks
* Deep Learning Hands-on (Python and R)
